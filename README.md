Introduction:

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, spikes in case numbers and hospitalizations put significant strain on hospitals and communities across the country. The goal of this project is to predict the number of COVID-19 cases in a given state on a given day as well as examine the causes underlying days with significantly higher COVID-19 case numbers. The ability to better understand and predict these increases in COVID-19 cases including where, when, and why these spikes occur would allow government and healthcare officials to more efficiently allocate resources to help mitigate the effects of future spikes.

Modeling: 

In this repository you will find the time series models, ARIMA, Seasonal ARIMA, Auto-ARIMA, Prophet (both Univariate and Multivariate), and XGBoost. THey are modeled on our dataset comprising covid information on covid-reporting, environental, political, location date for the top 10 US states by population. We limit our prediction from January 2022 to April 2022, predicting on data from March 2020 to December 2021.
